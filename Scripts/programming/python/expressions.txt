# Python 

---------
## Lesson One

* `%` modulo
    - calculates the remainder of a division.
```python
3 % 2 # this will output 1, as 2 fits in 3 only once and leaves out 1 as remainder
```

### Ex: Tip Calculator
```python
meal = 44.50
tax = 0.0675
tip = 0.15

meal = meal + meal * tax
total = meal + meal * tip

print("%.2f" % total) # "%.2f" is for two decimal places
```
* `len()`
    - gets the length (the number of characters) of a string.
```python
parrot = "Norwegian Blue" 
print len(parrot).
```
* `lower()`
    - gets rid of all the capitalization in your strings.
```python
parrot = "Norwegian Blue"
print "Norwegian Blue".lower()
```
* `upper()`
    - make a string completely upper case.
```python
parrot = "norwegian blue"
print "norwegian blue".upper()
```
* `str()`
    - turns non-strings into strings.
```python
pi = 3.14
print str(pi)
```
* `%`
    - is used to combine a string with variables. The % operator will replace a %s in the string with the string variable that comes after it.
```python
string_1 = "Camelot"
string_2 = "place"

print "Let's not go to %s. 'Tis a silly %s." % (string_1, string_2)
```
