package name as a string, and a boolean value indicating whether
the local repository for the package is available. In that case,
the return value of the function is used as the value of NO-CLONE
instead. In any case, if NO-CLONE is non-nil, then processing
stops here.

Otherwise, the repository is cloned, if it is missing. If
NO-BUILD is a function, then it is called with one argument: the
package name as a string. In that case, the return value of the
function is used as the value of NO-BUILD instead. In any case,
if NO-BUILD is non-nil, then processing halts here. Otherwise,
the package is built and activated. Note that if the package
recipe has a nil `:build' entry, then NO-BUILD is ignored
and processing always stops before building and activation
occurs.

CAUSE is a string explaining the reason why
`straight-use-package' has been called. It is for internal use
only, and is used to construct progress messages. INTERACTIVE is
non-nil if the function has been called interactively. It is for
internal use only, and is used to determine whether to show a
hint about how to install the package permanently.

Return non-nil when package is initially installed, nil otherwise.

:magic-fallback  Form to be added to `magic-fallback-mode-alist'.
:interpreter     Form to be added to `interpreter-mode-alist'.

:bind-keymap     Bind a key prefix to an auto-loaded keymap defined in the

:functions       Declare certain functions to silence the byte-compiler.
:load-path       Add to the `load-path' before attempting to load the package.
:diminish        Support for diminish.el (if installed).
:delight         Support for delight.el (if installed).
:custom          Call `Custom-set' or `set-default' with each variable

                 (compare with `custom-set-variables').
:custom-face     Call `custom-set-faces' with each face definition.
:ensure          Loads the package using package.el if necessary.
:pin             Pin the package to an archive.
:vc              Install the package directly from a version control system

NAME should be a symbol, it will be the prefix of all functions
defined here.

BODY has the format:

    (BODY-MAP BODY-KEY &rest BODY-PLIST)

DOCSTRING will be displayed in the echo area to identify the
Hydra.  When DOCSTRING starts with a newline, special Ruby-style
substitution will be performed by `hydra--format'.

Functions are created on basis of HEADS, each of which has the
format:

    (KEY CMD &optional HINT &rest PLIST)

BODY-MAP is a keymap; `global-map' is used quite often.  Each
function generated from HEADS will be bound in BODY-MAP to
BODY-KEY + KEY (both are strings passed to `kbd'), and will set
the transient map so that all following heads can be called
though KEY only.  BODY-KEY can be an empty string.

CMD is a callable expression: either an interactive function
name, or an interactive lambda, or a single sexp (it will be
wrapped in an interactive lambda).

HINT is a short string that identifies its head.  It will be
printed beside KEY in the echo erea if `hydra-is-helpful' is not
nil.  If you don't even want the KEY to be printed, set HINT
explicitly to nil.

The heads inherit their PLIST from BODY-PLIST and are allowed to
override some keys.  The keys recognized are :exit, :bind, and :column.
:exit can be:

- nil (default): this head will continue the Hydra state.
- t: this head will stop the Hydra state.

:bind can be:
- nil: this head will not be bound in BODY-MAP.
- a lambda taking KEY and CMD used to bind a head.

:column is a string that sets the column for all subsequent heads.

It is possible to omit both BODY-MAP and BODY-KEY if you don't
want to bind anything.  In that case, typically you will bind the
generated NAME/body command.  This command is also the return
result of `defhydra'.

  - `:separator' a single char used to generate the separator

  - `:title' a string that's added to the beginning of the

The initial input is given by the INITIAL argument.  DIR can be nil, a

directories or files to search in.  Multiple directories or files must

the `default-directory' is searched.  If the command is invoked with a

not yet inside a project, or the current project is searched.

The input string is split, the first part of the string (grep input) is
passed to the asynchronous grep process and the second part of the
string is passed to the completion-style filtering.

The input string is split at a punctuation character, which is given as
the first character of the input string.  The format is similar to
Perl-style regular expressions, e.g., /regexp/.  Furthermore command
line options can be passed to grep, specified behind --.  The overall
prompt input has the form `#async-input -- grep-opts#filter-string'.

Note that the grep input string is transformed from Emacs regular
expressions to Posix regular expressions.  Always enter Emacs regular
expressions at the prompt.  `consult-grep' behaves like builtin Emacs
search commands, e.g., Isearch, which take Emacs regular expressions.
Furthermore the asynchronous input split into words, each word must
match separately and in any order.  See `consult--regexp-compiler' for
the inner workings.  In order to disable transformations of the grep
input, adjust `consult--regexp-compiler' accordingly.

Here we give a few example inputs:

#alpha beta         : Search for alpha and beta in any order.
#alpha.*beta        : Search for alpha before beta.
#\\(alpha\\|beta\\) : Search for alpha or beta (Note Emacs syntax!)

In `flycheck-mode' the buffer is automatically syntax-checked
using the first suitable syntax checker from `flycheck-checkers'.
Use `flycheck-select-checker' to select a checker for the current
buffer manually.

If you run into issues, use `\\[flycheck-verify-setup]' to get help.

Flycheck supports many languages out of the box, and many
additional ones are available on MELPA.  Adding new ones is very
easy.  Complete documentation is available online at URL
`https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/'.  Please report issues and
request features at URL `https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck'.

Flycheck displays its status in the mode line.  In the default
configuration, it looks like this:

`FlyC'     This buffer has not been checked yet.
`FlyC*'    Flycheck is running.  Expect results soon!
`FlyC:0'   Last check resulted in no errors and no warnings.
`FlyC:3|5' This buffer contains three errors and five warnings.
           Use `\\[flycheck-list-errors]' to see the list.
`FlyC-'    Flycheck doesn't have a checker for this buffer.

You may also see the following icons:
`FlyC!'    The checker crashed.
`FlyC.'    The last syntax check was manually interrupted.
`FlyC?'    The checker did something unexpected, like exiting with 1
           but returning no errors.

The following keybindings are available in `flycheck-mode':

\\{flycheck-mode-map}
(you can change the prefix by customizing
`flycheck-keymap-prefix')

(fn &optional ARG)" t) (autoload 'flycheck-define-error-level "flycheck" "Define a new error LEVEL with PROPERTIES.

The following PROPERTIES constitute an error level:

`:severity SEVERITY'
     A number denoting the severity of this level.  The higher
     the number, the more severe is this level compared to other
     levels.  Defaults to 0; info is -10, warning is 10, and
     error is 100.

     The severity is used by `flycheck-error-level-<' to
     determine the ordering of errors according to their levels.

`:compilation-level LEVEL'

     A number indicating the broad class of messages that errors
     at this level belong to: one of 0 (info), 1 (warning), or
     2 or nil (error).  Defaults to nil.

     This is used by `flycheck-checker-pattern-to-error-regexp'
     to map error levels into `compilation-mode''s hierarchy and
     to get proper highlighting of errors in `compilation-mode'.

`:overlay-category CATEGORY'
     A symbol denoting the overlay category to use for error
     highlight overlays for this level.  See Info
     node `(elisp)Overlay Properties' for more information about
     overlay categories.

     A category for an error level overlay should at least define
     the `face' property, for error highlighting.  Another useful
     property for error level categories is `priority', to
     influence the stacking of multiple error level overlays.

`:fringe-bitmap BITMAPS'
     A fringe bitmap symbol denoting the bitmap to use for fringe
     indicators for this level, or a cons of two bitmaps (one for
     narrow fringes and one for wide fringes).  See Info node
     `(elisp)Fringe Bitmaps' for more information about fringe
     bitmaps, including a list of built-in fringe bitmaps.

`:fringe-face FACE'
     A face symbol denoting the face to use for fringe indicators
     for this level.

`:margin-spec SPEC'
     A display specification indicating what to display in the
     margin when `flycheck-indication-mode' is `left-margin' or
     `right-margin'.  See Info node `(elisp)Displaying in the
     Margins'.  If omitted, Flycheck generates an image spec from
     the fringe bitmap.

`:error-list-face FACE'
     A face symbol denoting the face to use for messages of this
     level in the error list.  See `flycheck-list-errors'.

(fn LEVEL &rest PROPERTIES)") (function-put 'flycheck-define-error-level 'lisp-indent-function 1) (autoload 'flycheck-define-command-checker "flycheck" "Define SYMBOL as syntax checker to run a command.

Define SYMBOL as generic syntax checker via
`flycheck-define-generic-checker', which uses an external command
to check the buffer.  SYMBOL and DOCSTRING are the same as for
`flycheck-define-generic-checker'.

In addition to the properties understood by
`flycheck-define-generic-checker', the following PROPERTIES
constitute a command syntax checker.  Unless otherwise noted, all
properties are mandatory.  Note that the default `:error-filter'
of command checkers is `flycheck-sanitize-errors'.

`:command COMMAND'
     The command to run for syntax checking.

     COMMAND is a list of the form `(EXECUTABLE [ARG ...])'.

     EXECUTABLE is a string with the executable of this syntax
     checker.  It can be overridden with the variable
     `flycheck-SYMBOL-executable'.  Note that this variable is
     NOT implicitly defined by this function.  Use
     `flycheck-def-executable-var' to define this variable.

     Each ARG is an argument to the executable, either as string,
     or as special symbol or form for
     `flycheck-substitute-argument', which see.

`:error-patterns PATTERNS'
     A list of patterns to parse the output of the `:command'.

     Each ITEM in PATTERNS is a list `(LEVEL SEXP ...)', where
     LEVEL is a Flycheck error level (see
     `flycheck-define-error-level'), followed by one or more RX
     `SEXP's which parse an error of that level and extract line,
     column, file name and the message.

     See `rx' for general information about RX, and
     `flycheck-rx-to-string' for some special RX forms provided
     by Flycheck.

     All patterns are applied in the order of declaration to the
     whole output of the syntax checker.  Output already matched
     by a pattern will not be matched by subsequent patterns.  In
     other words, the first pattern wins.

     This property is optional.  If omitted, however, an
     `:error-parser' is mandatory.

`:error-parser FUNCTION'
     A function to parse errors with.

     The function shall accept three arguments OUTPUT CHECKER
     BUFFER.  OUTPUT is the syntax checker output as string,
     CHECKER the syntax checker that was used, and BUFFER a
     buffer object representing the checked buffer.  The function
     must return a list of `flycheck-error' objects parsed from
     OUTPUT.

     This property is optional.  If omitted, it defaults to
     `flycheck-parse-with-patterns'.  In this case,
     `:error-patterns' is mandatory.

`:standard-input t'
     Whether to send the buffer contents on standard input.

     If this property is given and has a non-nil value, send the
     contents of the buffer on standard input.

     Some checkers that support reading from standard input have
     a separate flag to indicate the name of the file whose
     contents are being passed on standard input (typically
     `stdin-filename').  In that case, use the `(option)' form in
     `:command' to pass the value of variable `buffer-file-name'
     when the current buffer has a file name (that is,
     use `option \"--stdin-file-name\" buffer-file-name').

     For buffers not backed by files, checkers that support input
     on stdin typically report a file name like `-' or `<stdin>'.
     Make sure your error parser or patterns expect these file
     names (for example, use `(or \"<stdin>\" (file-name))') or
     call `flycheck-remove-error-file-names' in a custom
     `:error-filter'.

     Defaults to nil.

Note that you may not give `:start', `:interrupt', and
`:print-doc' for a command checker.  You can give a custom
`:verify' function, though, whose results will be appended to the
default `:verify' function of command checkers.

 (1) POSITION

POSITION can be:
1. An integer, meaning point position.
2. A cons of two integers, meaning absolute X and Y coordinates.
3. Other type, in which case the corresponding POSHANDLER should be
   provided.

 (2) POSHANDLER

POSHANDLER is a function of one argument returning an actual
position.  Its argument is a plist of the following form:

  (:position xxx
   :poshandler xxx
   :font-height xxx
   :font-width xxx
   :posframe xxx
   :posframe-width xxx
   :posframe-height xxx
   :posframe-buffer xxx
   :parent-frame xxx
   :parent-window-start xxx
   :parent-window-end xxx
   :parent-window-left xxx
   :parent-window-top xxx
   :parent-frame-width xxx
   :parent-frame-height xxx
   :parent-window xxx
   :parent-window-width  xxx
   :parent-window-height xxx
   :mouse-x xxx
   ;mouse-y xxx
   :minibuffer-height xxx
   :mode-line-height  xxx
   :header-line-height xxx
   :tab-line-height xxx
   :x-pixel-offset xxx
   :y-pixel-offset xxx)

By default, poshandler is auto-selected based on the type of POSITION,
but the selection can be overridden using the POSHANDLER argument.

The builtin poshandler functions are listed below:

1.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-center'
2.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-center'
3.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-left-corner'
4.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-right-corner'
5.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-left-or-right-other-corner'
6.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-center'
7.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-left-corner'
8.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-right-corner'
9.  `posframe-poshandler-window-center'
10.  `posframe-poshandler-window-top-center'
11. `posframe-poshandler-window-top-left-corner'
12. `posframe-poshandler-window-top-right-corner'
13. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-center'
14. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-left-corner'
15. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-right-corner'
16. `posframe-poshandler-point-top-left-corner'
17. `posframe-poshandler-point-bottom-left-corner'
18. `posframe-poshandler-point-bottom-left-corner-upward'
19. `posframe-poshandler-point-window-center'
20. `posframe-poshandler-point-frame-center'

 (3) POSHANDLER-EXTRA-INFO

POSHANDLER-EXTRA-INFO is a plist, which will prepend to the
argument of poshandler function: `info', it will *OVERRIDE* the
exist key in `info'.

 (4) BUFFER-OR-NAME

This posframe's buffer is BUFFER-OR-NAME, which can be a buffer
or a name of a (possibly nonexistent) buffer.

buffer name can prefix with space, for example \" *mybuffer*\", so
the buffer name will hide for ibuffer and `list-buffers'.

 (5) NO-PROPERTIES

If NO-PROPERTIES is non-nil, The STRING's properties will
be removed before being shown in posframe.

 (6) HEIGHT, MAX-HEIGHT, MIN-HEIGHT, WIDTH, MAX-WIDTH and MIN-WIDTH

These arguments are specified in the canonical character width
and height of posframe, more details can be found in docstring of
function `fit-frame-to-buffer',

 (7) LEFT-FRINGE and RIGHT-FRINGE

If LEFT-FRINGE or RIGHT-FRINGE is a number, left fringe or
right fringe with be shown with the specified width.

 (8) BORDER-WIDTH, BORDER-COLOR, INTERNAL-BORDER-WIDTH and INTERNAL-BORDER-COLOR

By default, posframe shows no borders, but users can specify
borders by setting BORDER-WIDTH to a positive number.  Border
color can be specified by BORDER-COLOR.

INTERNAL-BORDER-WIDTH and INTERNAL-BORDER-COLOR are same as
BORDER-WIDTH and BORDER-COLOR, but do not suggest to use for the
reason:

   Add distinct controls for child frames' borders (Bug#45620)
   http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=ff7b1a133bfa7f2614650f8551824ffaef13fadc

 (9) FONT, FOREGROUND-COLOR and BACKGROUND-COLOR

Posframe's font as well as foreground and background colors are
derived from the current frame by default, but can be overridden
using the FONT, FOREGROUND-COLOR and BACKGROUND-COLOR arguments,
respectively.

 (10) CURSOR, TTY-NON-SELECTED-CURSOR and WINDOW-POINT

By default, cursor is not showed in posframe, user can let cursor
showed with this argument help by set its value to a `cursor-type'.

TTY-NON-SELECTED-CURSOR will let redisplay put the terminal
cursor in a non-selected frame, which is useful when use
vertico-posframe like package in tty.

When cursor need to be showed in posframe, user may need to set
WINDOW-POINT to the point of BUFFER, which can let cursor showed
at this point.

 (11) RESPECT-HEADER-LINE and RESPECT-MODE-LINE

By default, posframe will display no header-line, mode-line and
tab-line.  In case a header-line, mode-line or tab-line is
desired, users can set RESPECT-HEADER-LINE and RESPECT-MODE-LINE
to t.

 (12) INITIALIZE

INITIALIZE is a function with no argument.  It will run when
posframe buffer is first selected with `with-current-buffer'
in `posframe-show', and only run once (for performance reasons).

 (13) LINES-TRUNCATE

If LINES-TRUNCATE is non-nil, then lines will truncate in the
posframe instead of wrap.

 (14) OVERRIDE-PARAMETERS

OVERRIDE-PARAMETERS is very powful, *all* the valid frame parameters
used by posframe's frame can be overridden by it.

NOTE: some `posframe-show' arguments are not frame parameters, so they
can not be overrided by this argument.

 (15) TIMEOUT

TIMEOUT can specify the number of seconds after which the posframe
will auto-hide.

 (15) REFRESH

If REFRESH is a number, posframe's frame-size will be re-adjusted
every REFRESH seconds.

 (17) ACCEPT-FOCUS

When ACCEPT-FOCUS is non-nil, posframe will accept focus.
be careful, you may face some bugs when set it to non-nil.

 (18) HIDEHANDLER

HIDEHANDLER is a function, when it return t, posframe will be
hide, this function has a plist argument:

  (:posframe-buffer xxx
   :posframe-parent-buffer xxx)

The builtin hidehandler functions are listed below:

1. `posframe-hidehandler-when-buffer-switch'

 (19) REFPOSHANDLER

REFPOSHANDLER is a function, a reference position (most is
top-left of current frame) will be returned when call this
function.

when it is nil or it return nil, child-frame feature will be used
and reference position will be deal with in Emacs.

The user case I know at the moment is let ivy-posframe work well
in EXWM environment (let posframe show on the other application
window).

         DO NOT USE UNLESS NECESSARY!!!

An example parent frame poshandler function is:

1. `posframe-refposhandler-xwininfo'

 (19) Others

You can use `posframe-delete-all' to delete all posframes.

This is a minor mode meant for those who do not care about treemacs' workspace
features, or its preference to work with multiple projects simultaneously.  When
enabled it will function as an automated version of
`treemacs-display-current-project-exclusively', making sure that, after a small
idle delay, the current project, and *only* the current project, is displayed in
treemacs.

The project detection is based on the current buffer, and will try to determine
the project using the following methods, in the order they are listed:

- the current projectile.el project, if `treemacs-projectile' is installed
- the current project.el project
- the current `default-directory'

The update will only happen when treemacs is in the foreground, meaning a
treemacs window must exist in the current scope.

thus disable `treemacs-follow-mode' on activation.  When enabled treemacs will
focus not only the file of the current buffer, but also the tag at point.

The follow action is attached to Emacs' idle timer and will run
`treemacs-tag-follow-delay' seconds of idle time.  The delay value is not an
integer, meaning it accepts floating point values like 1.5.

Every time a tag is followed a re--scan of the imenu index is forced by
temporarily setting `imenu-auto-rescan' to t (though a cache is applied as long
as the buffer is unmodified).  This is necessary to assure that creation or
deletion of tags does not lead to errors and guarantees an always up-to-date tag
view.

Note that in order to move to a tag in treemacs the treemacs buffer's window
needs to be temporarily selected, which will reset blink-cursor-mode's timer if
it is enabled.  This will result in the cursor blinking seemingly pausing for a
short time and giving the appearance of the tag follow action lasting much
longer than it really does.

.. [#] `&allow-other-keys\\=' is a special \"markers\" available in macros
   in the CL library for function definition such as `cl-defun\\=' and
   `cl-function\\='.  Without this marker, you need to specify all arguments
   to be passed.  This becomes problem when request.el adds new arguments
   when calling callback functions.  If you use `&allow-other-keys\\='
   (or manually ignore other arguments), your code is free from this
   problem.  See info node `(cl) Argument Lists\\=' for more information.

Arguments data, error-thrown, symbol-status can be accessed by
`request-response-data\\=', `request-response-error-thrown\\=',
`request-response-symbol-status\\=' accessors, i.e.::

    (request-response-data RESPONSE)  ; same as data

Response object holds other information which can be accessed by
the following accessors:
`request-response-status-code\\=',
`request-response-url\\=' and
`request-response-settings\\='

* STATUS-CODE callback

STATUS-CODE is an alist of the following format::

    ((N-1 . CALLBACK-1)
     (N-2 . CALLBACK-2)
     ...)

Here, N-1, N-2,... are integer status codes such as 200.


* FILES

FILES is an alist of the following format::

    ((NAME-1 . FILE-1)
     (NAME-2 . FILE-2)
     ...)

where FILE-N is a list of the form::

    (FILENAME &key PATH BUFFER STRING MIME-TYPE)

FILE-N can also be a string (path to the file) or a buffer object.
In that case, FILENAME is set to the file name or buffer name.

Example FILES argument::

    `((\"passwd\"   . \"/etc/passwd\")                ; filename = passwd
      (\"scratch\"  . ,(get-buffer \"*scratch*\"))    ; filename = *scratch*
      (\"passwd2\"  . (\"password.txt\" :file \"/etc/passwd\"))
      (\"scratch2\" . (\"scratch.txt\"  :buffer ,(get-buffer \"*scratch*\")))
      (\"data\"     . (\"data.csv\"     :data \"1,2,3\\n4,5,6\\n\")))

.. note:: FILES is implemented only for curl backend for now.
   As furl.el_ supports multipart POST, it should be possible to
   support FILES in pure elisp by making furl.el_ another backend.
   Contributions are welcome.

   .. _furl.el: https://code.google.com/p/furl-el/


* PARSER function

PARSER function takes no argument and it is executed in the
buffer with HTTP response body.  The current position in the HTTP
response buffer is at the beginning of the buffer.  As the HTTP
header is stripped off, the cursor is actually at the beginning
of the response body.  So, for example, you can pass `json-read\\='
to parse JSON object in the buffer.  To fetch whole response as a
string, pass `buffer-string\\='.

When using `json-read\\=', it is useful to know that the returned
type can be modified by `json-object-type\\=', `json-array-type\\=',
`json-key-type\\=', `json-false\\=' and `json-null\\='.  See docstring of
each function for what it does.  For example, to convert JSON
objects to plist instead of alist, wrap `json-read\\=' by `lambda\\='
like this.::

    (request
     \"https://...\"
     :parser (lambda ()
               (let ((json-object-type \\='plist))
                 (json-read)))
     ...)

This is analogous to the `dataType\\=' argument of jQuery.ajax_.
Only this function can access to the process buffer, which
is killed immediately after the execution of this function.

* SYNC

Synchronous request is functional, but *please* don\\='t use it
other than testing or debugging.  Emacs users have better things
to do rather than waiting for HTTP request.  If you want a better
way to write callback chains, use `request-deferred\\='.

If you can\\='t avoid using it (e.g., you are inside of some hook
which must return some value), make sure to set TIMEOUT to
relatively small value.

Due to limitation of `url-retrieve-synchronously\\=', response slots
`request-response-error-thrown\\=', `request-response-history\\=' and
`request-response-url\\=' are unknown (always nil) when using
synchronous request with `url-retrieve\\=' backend.

* Note

API of `request\\=' is somewhat mixture of jQuery.ajax_ (Javascript)
and requests.request_ (Python).

       (lambda (result)
         (message \"Async process done, result should be 222: %s\"
                  result)))

If you call `async-send' from a child process, the message will
be also passed to the FINISH-FUNC.  You can test RESULT to see if
it is a message by using `async-message-p'.  If nil, it means
this is the final result.  Example of the FINISH-FUNC:

    (lambda (result)
      (if (async-message-p result)
          (message \"Received a message from child process: %s\" result)
        (message \"Async process done, result: %s\" result)))

If FINISH-FUNC is nil or missing, a future is returned that can
be inspected using `async-get', blocking until the value is
ready.  Example:

    (let ((proc (async-start
                   ;; What to do in the child process
                   (lambda ()
                     (message \"This is a test\")

        (message \"I'm going to do some work here\") ;; ....

        (message \"Waiting on async process, result should be 222: %s\"
                 (async-get proc)))

If you don't want to use a callback, and you don't care about any
return value from the child process, pass the `ignore' symbol as
the second argument (if you don't, and never call `async-get', it
will leave *emacs* process buffers hanging around):

    (async-start
     (lambda ()
       (delete-file \"a remote file on a slow link\" nil))
     \\='ignore)

Special case:
If the output of START-FUNC is a string with properties
e.g. (buffer-string) RESULT will be transformed in a list where the
car is the string itself (without props) and the cdr the rest of
properties, this allows using in FINISH-FUNC the string without
properties and then apply the properties in cdr to this string (if
needed).
Properties handling special objects like markers are returned as
list to allow restoring them later.
See <https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async/issues/145> for more infos.

Note: Even when FINISH-FUNC is present, a future is still
returned except that it yields no value (since the value is
passed to FINISH-FUNC).  Call `async-get' on such a future always
returns nil.  It can still be useful, however, as an argument to

This is done via Emacs Lisp (no dependence on external grep).
Return list of filematches.

FILE-NAME-RE can be a regexp or a filter function taking a list of file names
and returning a filtered list of file names.

Each filematch is a cons (file . matchdata).
file is the file name.
matchdata is a list of matches.
Each match is a list of sub-matches.
Each submatch is a plist of :match, :context, :line,
:linestart, :beg and :end.

OPTIONS is a plist
Flags:

:abs absolute file names
t: full absolute file names;
nil: (default) file names relative to `default-directory'
of the last visited buffer

:interactive
t: call as interactive

:r-beg record begin
Beginning of next record.
Can be a regular expression, a function without args
or a list of record delimiters.
If the function finds a record beginning, it should return its position
like `search-forward'.
Search starts at buffer beginning or at end of last record.
Defaults to `point-min'.
A list of record delimiters allows to define nested records.
One example where this becomes handy is, when one wants to grep
for identifiers in org source blocks within certain sections of Org-files.
In that example the first record could start at a match of \"^\\* SECTION\"
and end at a match of \"^\\* \\|\\'\"
and the second record could be delimited by matches of
\" *#+begin_src\" and \" *#+end_src\".
A list of record delimiters is marked with the value t in its first element.
Starting with its cdr, it contains record delimiters.
Each record delimiter is a list.
The first element of that list is the regular expression or
the function matching the beginning of the record
and the second element of that list is the regular expression
or function matching the end of the record.
For the above example the `elgrep' command would look like:
(elgrep ...
    :r-beg (t
            (\"^\\\\* W:22205\" \"^\\\\* \\\\|\\\\'\")
            (\" *#\\\\+begin_src\" \" *#\\\\+end_src \"))
    ...)

:r-end record end
End of record.
Can be a regular expression or a function without args.
If the function finds a record end it should return its position
like `search-forward'.
Search starts at search result for :r-beg.
Defaults to `point-max'.

:c-beg context begin (line beginning)
Lines before match defaults to 0. Can also be a regular expression.
Then this re is searched for in backward-direction
starting at the beginning of the current elgrep-match.
It can also be a function moving point to the context beginning
starting at the match of RE.

:c-end context end (line end)
Lines behind match defaults to 0. Can also be a regular expression.
Then this re is searched for in forward-direction
starting at the end of the current elgrep-match.
It can also be a function moving point to the context end
starting at the match of :c-beg.

:c-beg-only
Use the context beginning literally.
That means do not extend the context to the beginning of line.

:c-end-only
Use the context end literally.
That means do not extend the context to the end of line.

:c-op
Context operation gets beginning and end position of context as arguments.
Defaults to `buffer-substring-no-properties'.

:recursive
t: also grep recursively subdirectories in dir
(also if called interactively with prefix arg)
Defaults to nil.

:symlink
t: also follow symbolic links when recursing

:formatter
Formatting function to call for each match
if called interactively with non-nil RE.
Inputs: format string \"%s:%d:%s
\", file-name, line number,

:exclude-file-re
Regular expression matching the files that should not be grepped.
Do not exclude files if this option is nil, unset, or the empty string.
Can also be a filter function that gets the full list of file names
as argument and should return the filtered list to be used for `elgrep'.
Defaults to nil.

:dir-re
Regular expression matching the directories
that should be entered in recursive grep.
Defaults to \"\".

:exclude-dir-re
Regular expression matching the directories
that should not be entered in recursive grep.
If this is the empty string no directories are excluded.
Defaults to \"^\\.\".

:case-fold-search
Ignore case if non-nil.
Defaults to the value of `case-fold-search'.

:buffer-init may be one of the following symbols:
nil (default): Do not initialize buffer.
syntax-table: Just set the syntax table corresponding
              to the auto-mode of the file.
major-mode: Full major-mode initialization of the auto-mode corresponding
            to the file.

:file-fun
Predicate function called with the file path as argument.
The function should return non-nil if that file should be searched.
If the return value is a string it is used as new file name for `elgrep-save'.
Option :abs decides whether the path is relative or absolute.

:search-fun
Function to search forward for occurences of RE
with the same arguments as `re-search-forward'.
It gets RE as first argument.
Thereby it is not required that RE is a regular expression.
Defaults to `re-search-forward'.

:keep-elgrep-buffer
Keep buffer <*elgrep*> even when there are no matches.

:no-header
Avoid descriptive header into <*elgrep*> buffer.

:async
Asynchronous search (experimental).
Search synchronous if this option is nil,
search in a separate thread if this option is equal to 'thread,
and search with the help of the library async otherwise.

:mindepth Minimal depth. Defaults to 0.

:maxdepth Maximal depth. Defaults to the value of `most-positive-fixnum'.

:depth Internal. Should not be used.

Each match is a list of sub-matches.
Each submatch is a plist of :match, :context, :line,

FILE-NAME-RE can also be a list of FILE-NAME-MATCHERs.

Each FILE-NAME-MATCHER can be a regular expression

The FILTERs are treated as regular expressions but the references
like \\1 are inserted in a quoted form (via `regexp-quote').

If SUBST1 starts with ?\\! then file names matching SUBST1
