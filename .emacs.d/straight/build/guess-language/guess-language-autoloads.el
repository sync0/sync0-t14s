Toggle guess-language mode.

This is a minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`Guess-Language mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive,
enable the mode, and if it is zero or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable
the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.
Disable the mode if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate `guess-language-mode'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when
it is disabled.

Interactively with no argument, this command toggles the mode.
A positive prefix argument enables the mode, any other prefix
argument disables it.  From Lisp, argument omitted or nil enables
the mode, `toggle' toggles the state.

Guess-language is a buffer-local minor mode.  It guesses the
language of the current paragraph when flyspell detects an
incorrect word and changes ispell's dictionary and typo-mode
accordingly.  If the language settings change, flyspell is rerun
on the current paragraph.  If the paragraph is shorter than
`guess-language-min-paragraph-length', none of the above happens
because there is likely not enough text to guess the language
correctly.
